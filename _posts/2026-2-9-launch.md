The [Science Press of the Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle (MNHN)](https://sciencepress.mnhn.fr/en) officially joins the [GBIF-hosted portals programme](https://www.gbif.org/hosted-portals), walking in the footsteps of the [European Journal of Taxonomy](https://data.europeanjournaloftaxonomy.eu). This marks a new step forward the access and reuse of material data derived from scientific literature.

[As introduced last year](https://www.gbif.org/news/2JHV6IsWcUUrD57I3FgXIQ/european-journal-of-taxonomy-launches-gbif-hosted-portal), users can resort to [powerful search](http://data.sciencepress.fr/occurrence/search/) and visualization tools, and explore advanced features such as [data clustering](http://data.sciencepress.fr/occurrence/search/?view=CLUSTERS) which enables the discovery of overlooked occurrences and sources by identifying related type specimens and linkages between records from different sources. This combination extends the reach of occurrences in GBIF to taxonomic treatments and original publications.

Founded in 1793, the [Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle, Paris](https://www.mnhn.fr/en) has long been committed to sharing knowledge by publishing [series](https://sciencepress.mnhn.fr/en/series) and [journals](https://sciencepress.mnhn.fr/en/journals) as early as 1802. Since 2000, MNHN journals have embraced the [diamond open access model](https://www.unesco.org/en/diamond-open-access) and have gradually adopted the [CC-BY license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Over the last decade, the MNHN partnered with Swiss-based organization [Plazi](https://plazi.org/) to extract and semantically enhance published articles through its conversion pipeline, allowing newly FAIRized data (taxonomic names, taxonomic treatments, material citations…) to be mobilized to data infrastructures such as [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/), [Catalogue of Life](https://www.catalogueoflife.org/), and the shared [ChecklistBank](https://www.checklistbank.org/). Today, the MNHN is pleased to announce the release of 8 GBIF-hosted portals:

* [Adansonia](https://data.adansonia.com)
* [Comptes Rendus Palevol](https://data.cr-palevol.fr)
* [Cryptogamie, Algologie](https://data-algologie.cryptogamie.com)
* [Cryptogamie, Bryologie](https://data-bryologie.cryptogamie.com)
* [Cryptogamie, Mycologie](https://data-mycologie.cryptogamie.com)
* [Geodiversitas](https://data.geodiversitas.com)
* [Zoosystema](https://data.zoosystema.com)
* [Paris Museum Science Press](http://data.sciencepress.fr)


To date, more than [135,000 occurrences](http://data.sciencepress.fr/occurrence/search/?view=table) across more than [2,400 datasets](http://data.sciencepress.fr/dataset/search/) (including EJT) have been mobilized to GBIF via Plazi and are now easily accessible through the aforementioned portals. Records mobilized from Paris journals have been widely cited, generating more than [840 citations](http://data.sciencepress.fr/literature/search/) in a wide range of global research.

Through this release, the Muséum reaches a new milestone in the enhancement of taxonomic and natural history knowledge, reaffirming commitment to open science and further expanding the community of scientific publishers participating in the GBIF-hosted portals programme, for the benefit of the global scientific community.
