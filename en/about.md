The [Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle, Paris](https://www.mnhn.fr) has published scientific works in the fields of Natural Sciences and Humanities since 1802. The [Science Press](https://sciencepress.mnhn.fr) currently publishes its own [journals](https://sciencepress.mnhn.fr/en/journals), [series and monographs](https://sciencepress.mnhn.fr/en/series), as well as titles co-published with other major research structures.

The MNHN Science Press is responsible for the technical evaluation of submissions, the coordination of manuscripts through the peer-review process and the production of final publications. We ensure the dissemination, archiving and sale of all works published by the department. Each title or collection is under the scientific responsibility of a qualified topic editor and peer-reviewed by international experts. Each journal and monograph series is also assigned to a specialist desk editor who manages the production and distribution operations for the publication.

The publications of the MNHN Science Press are indexed in all relevant data infrastructures, including the Web of Knowledge (Clarivate analytics) and Scopus (Elsevier). The periodical journals each possess an impact factor. All articles published by the MNHN Science Press journals are available free of charge, directly upon publication.

As well as serving to identify the author, scientific publications aim to communicate original research results to national and international communities. The intellectual influence of a research institution and the evaluation of its researchers are partly based on its academic press activities.
